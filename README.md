# Cartoon-Images-CV-Project

The aim of this project is to generate a cartoon look using GAN. 


It consists of several files: 

- The notebook **Cartoonify_Project.ipynb** contains all the stages of the project (dataset, model construction, training and testing phase).

- The notebook **Cartoon_cv2.ipynb** contains more details about the creation of a cartoonize function with cv2 library.

- The **Flask.py** file is used to process an image dropped into the interface.

- The interface is located in the **templates** folder

- The model is saved in the **generator.pth** file.

We used this dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommykamaz/faces-dataset-small.
